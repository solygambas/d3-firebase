# Build Data Visualizations with D3.js & Firebase

3 small projects to understand D3.js basics.

## Features

- creating simple SVG shapes and appending them to the DOM with D3.js.
- changing attributes with .attr() and grouping elements together.
- joining JSON data to elements and adding virtual elements to the DOM.
- using linear and band scales with min, max and extent.
- creating a bar chart: centering a graph, adding axes and formatting ticks.
- creating a Firestore database, setting up the Firebase config and getting data from Firestore.
